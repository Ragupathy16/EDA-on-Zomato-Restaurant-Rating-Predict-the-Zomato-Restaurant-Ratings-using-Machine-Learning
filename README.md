# Zomato-Restaurant-Ratings-EDA and -Machine-Learning-Project

## ABSTRACT
#### Zomato was launched in 2010. Zomato's technology platform connects customers, restaurant partners and delivery partners, serving their multiple needs. Customers use the Zomato platform to search and discover restaurants, read and write customer-generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table and make payments while dining out at restaurants.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
#### The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasnâ€™t been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. In spite of increasing demand, it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. 

## CONCLUSION

#### Our ExtraTree Regressor algorithm yields the highest accuracy, 93.28%. Any accuracy above 70% is considered good, but be careful because if your accuracy is extremely high, it may be too good to be true (an example of Overfitting). Thus, 80% is the ideal accuracy!
#### Out of the 8 features we examined, the top 5 significant features that helped us to predict the rating (i.e.) rate, rest_type, votes, cuisines and book_table.         
#### Our machine learning algorithm will able to predict the restaurant rating.
